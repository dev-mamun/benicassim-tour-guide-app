**_Android Basics Nanodegree_**

   _designed by Udacity & Google_

This program was composed of 5 courses:
* User Interface
* User Input
* Multi-screen apps
* Networking
* Databases

---

--> This project was the third and final project of the "Multi-screen apps" course (Project #6 of program).

--> The goal was to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information about a chosen city. The app was expected to list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city.

--> Project specifications can be found [here](documentation/udacity-abn-tour-guide-app-specifications.pdf).

--> I chose the city of <b>Benicassim</b> located in Spain, on the Mediterranean coast.
